This repo contains Matlab code for fitting light response curves. I believe this code requires the Global Optimization Toolbox in Matlab.  

# Contents of Matlab Code for L-Curve:

## Parameters_L_Curves_V5
Master script that runs scripts to import data then perform light curve fits. This is the main script that requires customization.

## Model_Parameterization_GA.m
Fits 7 different light curve formulas.

## importLCfile1.m
Example script to import file

## int_mutation
Code for genetic algorithm

## int_pop
Code for genetic algorithm

## L_Curve1 through L_Curve7
Code for different light response curves (run by Model_Parameterization_GA.m)

# Contents of Inputs
Includes and example file to try fitting

# Outputs
Outputs of light response curve fit will be generated here
